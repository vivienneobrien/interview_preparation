# Interview Preparation Documentation

### What to do:
1. Study Schedule (Goal & Time Orientated).
2. Simulate a real interview every time you study (25-30 minutes).
3. Know what you don't know (Be honest about your abilities).
4. Build a solid foundation in the basics. 

### What not to do:
1. Read question for 10 minutes, think about solution then look at the answer. You need to build the muscle to solve problems on your own. By doing it yourself, the struggle will help you apply what you have learnt from a specific problem to others. 
2. Do not memorise solutions. You are robbing yourself from experience by doing this. 
3. Do not keep pressing run. Digest your code before checking if it compiles. 

### When approaching a solution:
1. Focus on what is important in the question. 
2. Clear up ambiguity and use cases i.e. Lists: empty, negative, duplicates. Strings: Uppercase, lowercase, special characters).
3. Do not jump straight into the code.
4. Get a working solution.
5. Time/ Space Complexity: 
*	How to improve a data structure to impove time?
* 	How can we do this in memory to improve space?
6. Pseudocode. Outline the steps you want to take.
7. Look at code before you run it. 
8. Prepare for how a solution can change if x happens.

### Week 1 (28th September - 4th October)
*	Create Interview Preparation Repository.
*	Reach out to friends/mentors who are pilling to practice phone call interviews with you with the purpose of replicating an interview environment. 
*	Carry out 3 easy-level Hackerrank questions in the morning to build confidence.
*	Revise Big O in Cracking the Code Interview.
*	Solve the questions in Array & Strings chapter in Cracking the Code Interview.
*	Goals by end of week: 
		* Basic Revision of Java complete
		* Understanding of indexing in a loop
		* Ability to identify time & space complexity of all the algorithms implemented and why and understanding of Arrays&Strings.
